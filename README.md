# DaveProgrammingCompetitions
Here you will find the my solutions for several popular programming competitions in somewhat less traditional coding language choices (Python, Go, and Julia).
* [Google Codejam](./codejam).  Here I have solutions for the vast majority of the problems, primarily in Julia.  Longer term, I hope to fill in the collection and offer alternate solutions in both Python and Go.
* [Atcoder ABC](./abc).  The "beginner" contests from Atcoder are actually a great introduction to a number of algorithms (especially when looking at the 500 and 600 point problems).  I'm currently working on getting through solutions from contest abc160 onwards, although I may go backwards once I get to the end.  I'm also weekly trying to stay current to the new contests.  The solutions here are in Python and Go.
* [Facebook Hackercup](./hackercup).  
This repo also has my competitive programming "libraries" for Python, Julia and Go.  Use at your own risk (some of the code has yet to be validated).
* [Google Kickstart](./kickstart). Kickstart solutions (mostly in Go).
